# Grand Theft Auto 5 Server - G5S

G5S is a GTA 5 multiplayer mod. Development is focused on getting the server to a pristine stage right now,
and as such the client is not going to receive much attention.

There is currently no publicly available download, but you are free to clone this repository and build it
yourself.

## Features

As this project had only been in development for a few weeks, there isn't very much to it right now. These
are the features that are currently implemented:

* Cross-platform dedicated server.
* Client.
* Player movement synchronization.
* Fast entity streaming.
* A simple chat.
* Rockstar-like user interface.

## Running

G5S currently works as a .asi mod, and depends on ScriptHookV. To run this mod, you will need to have
the ASI loader (`dinput8.dll`), ScriptHookV itself (`ScriptHookV.dll`), and the mod's ASI file all in the
GTA 5 game folder.

It will generate a logfile which you can see the mod's events in, in case something breaks. It will also
attempt to load a .ini file for reading your nickname and quick-connect server. (F3 connects to this, and
F4 disconnects.) It's not required however, and you can still connect to any server by using the in-game
menu. Note that this file is not generated by default, you must make it yourself. Attempting to use any of
the features included in this file will cause the G5S client to crash.

The server shouldn't require any special configuration at this point in time.

## Building

Building the client is done using Visual Studio 2017.

Building the server can be done on Linux using `make`, or on Windows with Visual Studio. This is handled
via `cmake`. On Linux you will need to have the ENet library installed (eg. on Debian, the package is
`libenet-dev`), and on Windows you will need to locate the library manually.
